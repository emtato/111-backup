silly messages for incorrect directions:
Verily, thou dost proceed direction, yet fate, that cruel mistress, hath placed a stupendous monolithic barricade of fish and chips impeding in your promenade. Blimey I guess you'll have to pick another way
You head down yonder direction. Shucks! Got a no-good outlaw down that way. Whaddaya reckon we steer clear?
It is said the direction has been conquered by the Mongols now. A wise man does not walk into the tiger’s den, just as one does not row against the current of the Yellow River. Best we seek another road.
Should know better than direction in this weather eh? We don't want ourselves an impromptu ski trip, oui?
SACRE BLEU! You march direction, but mon dieu! A towering block of Camembert fromage blocks your path! C’est la vie... no choice, mon ami, we must find another route!
You try to step direction, but ¡AY CARAMBA!! A mariachi band appears out of nowhere, strumming furiously—no pasas, compadre!

Change? log?
    Added a bunch of helper functions in adventure file for better organization, and separated possible user
    actions into two categories; menu actions and events, where the menu actions dont count as an event and are
    not added to the event_log. Also, how should we handle picking up an object? idk how that should work.

em:
clean up edit some func, going in directions works
i kinda wanted to make a silly message if u cant go in the direction u chose
pick up obj should be an undoable action, be in non menu actions function

undo works, moves remaining works

system for id locations added:
    •	First digit = left-right (east-west) position
	•	Second digit = north-south position

Sidney Smith (SS) is the central reference point at 35.
	•	Moving south increases the second digit.
	•	Moving north decreases the second digit.
	•	Moving east (+) or west (-) changes the first digit.
    •   Top left corner of campus is 11, bottom right is 99
ex:
Since Bahen is south of SS, its ID is 37 (same first digit, higher second digit).
Since Robarts is north of SS, its ID is 33
check example image for a visual idea of how this works. the numbers arent completely accurate or evenly spaced, its just
more simple so "go south" we can simply add 1 or 2 to the second number in the id digit instead of looking for which id
we need
if u get too dizzy we dont have to use this but it hopefully makes sense

also idea that if cant find mug, buy it at the store

IMOPRTANT: on the chopping block (from my understanding): score player stat/ target points, start position (which is already encoded in location data)
and target position). the win condition for the game is to bring every item back home and submit, not a score based win

repurposed event log's description section to store its name for easier viewing in log. dont see why it would be necessary
for long description in log anyway

undoing picking up stuff and undoing movement works (all basic cases i tried maybe bugs)

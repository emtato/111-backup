idea i thought of and im gonna write down so i dont forget:
same location but changed (e.g. locked room becomes unlocked) use the game_data file to store info on
all the versions of each location and each have the same id/refer to the same id or something, and once a change is made,
in the dictionary in the adventure object you chNge what the id refers to so its the new location, so everything is the same
just with modifications made, and the alternate locations are stored somewhere else so they can be returned or something.


another thing i just realized: we don't need to undo pick up actions, we can just let the user drop and pick up as separate
functions instead woah. Gotta check if this is allowed but should fix a lot of issues.

orr, make Event an abstract class and make different types of events that perform different tasks.

also, move the game log to the adventure game class cuz that makes a bit more sense


note to self: youre gay
omg i really wanna make a place where u can only head to but going east or west or north or south from there all lead to the same
place in a loop you can never escape LMFAOO
